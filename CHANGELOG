-----------------

Fixed:
- Fix migration commands duplicating into multiple app's migrations


0.1 (2021/11/30)

- Restructured Tortoise and model initializing around the Tortoise Bot subclass. Model files are now explicitly
required in the `add_cog()` command ("Explicit is better than implicit.").
