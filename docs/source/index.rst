**Nextcord-Ormar** is a library to help integrate the async Django-inspired ORM
`Ormar <https://github.com/collerek/ormar>`_ with a Nextcord bot. It's designed to compliment the
modular Cog system of Nextcord. It also comes with NXAlembic, a preconfigured version of
`Alembic <https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic>`_ to help with creating and applying database
migrations.

Check out :doc:`usage` to get started!

Nextcord-Ormar is still in active development. If you have any questions or ideas on how to make it better, feel free
to open an issue!
