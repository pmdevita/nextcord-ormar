**Nextcord-Ormar** is a library to help integrate the async Django-inspired ORM
`Ormar <https://github.com/collerek/ormar>`_ with a `Nextcord <https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord/>`_ bot. It's
designed to compliment the modular Cog system of Nextcord. It also comes with NXAlembic, a preconfigured version of
`Alembic <https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic>`_ to help with creating and applying database
migrations.

Check out :doc:`usage` to get started!

Nextcord-Ormar is still in active development, there may be breaking changes as the library is polished up. If you have
any feedback, feel free to open an issue!
